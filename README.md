# benchmark_functions
This crate provides functionality for several functions that are commonly
used to benchmark new optimization algorithms. More specifically, function is part of a struct
that contains the objective function as well as other important information (bounds of the
canonical problem, the known minimum value, and a function that returns the global minimizer.
